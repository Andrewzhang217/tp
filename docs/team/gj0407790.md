## Project: SmartLib

SmartLib is a desktop app for managing private book loaning services owning less than 10,000 books, optimized for use via a Command Line Interface (CLI) while still having the benefits of a Graphical User Interface (GUI). If you can type fast, SmartLib can systematically manage your books and borrowersâ€™ information in a more efficient manner than traditional GUI apps.

Given below are my contributions to the project.

* **Code contributed**: [RepoSense link](https://nus-cs2103-ay2021s2.github.io/tp-dashboard/?search=gj0407790&sort=groupTitle&sortWithin=title&since=2021-02-19&timeframe=commit&mergegroup=&groupSelect=groupByRepos&breakdown=false&tabOpen=true&tabType=authorship&tabAuthor=GJ0407790&tabRepo=AY2021S2-CS2103T-W13-2%2Ftp%5Bmaster%5D&authorshipIsMergeGroup=false&authorshipFileTypes=docs~functional-code~test-code~other&authorshipIsBinaryFileTypeChecked=false)

* **New Feature**: Added the feature of deleting a book `deletebook`.
    * What it does: Allows the user to delete a book from the book list.
    * Justification: This feature is useful when the user added a book with wrong details, or the book is no longer in the store. Hence, user can delete those books. 
    * Credits: _AB3's prior implementation of `delete` guided the implementation of the `deletebook` command._

* **New Feature**: Added the feature of listing overdue books `listoverdue`.
    * What it does: Allows the user to list out all books that are overdue.
    * Justification: This feature is useful when the user wants to know which books are overdue so that user can contact the readers accordingly.

* **Enhancements to existing features**:
    * Updated the storage class to save the book details in when user modifies it (pull request [\#121](https://github.com/AY2021S2-CS2103T-W13-2/tp/pull/121))
    * Enhance the `return` feature, if the returned book is overdue, to show the how long the book is overdue and how much the reader has to pay(pull request [\#163](https://github.com/AY2021S2-CS2103T-W13-2/tp/pull/163)).

* **Documentation**:
    * User Guide:
        * Added documentation for the features `addbook`, `deletebook` and `listoverdue` (pull request 
          [\#77](https://github.com/AY2021S2-CS2103T-W13-2/tp/pull/77),
          [\#193](https://github.com/AY2021S2-CS2103T-W13-2/tp/pull/193))
    * Developer Guide:
        * Added implementation details of the `deletebook` feature and the logic of calculating the cosr of overdue book (pull request
          [\#151](https://github.com/AY2021S2-CS2103T-W13-2/tp/pull/151)).

* **Project management**:
    * Release jar file for v1.2, v1.3.
    * In charge of the quality and coverage of test cases.
    
* **Community**:
    * Reported bugs and suggestions for other teams in the class (example: [PE-D](https://github.com/gj0407790/ped/issues))
