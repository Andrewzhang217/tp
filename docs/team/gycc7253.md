## Project: SmartLib

SmartLib is a desktop app for managing private book loaning services owning less than 10,000 books, optimized for use via a Command Line Interface (CLI) while still having the benefits of a Graphical User Interface (GUI). If you can type fast, SmartLib can systematically manage your books and borrowersâ€™ information in a more efficient manner than traditional GUI apps.

Given below are my contributions to the project.

* **New Feature**: Added the feature of `borrow` and `return`
  * What it does: allows the user to record borrow and return activity
  * Version 1.2 Parameter: borrow by bookname and readername, return by bookname and readername (As version 1.2 bookname is the unique identifier of books) (pull requests
