## Project: SmartLib

SmartLib is a desktop app for managing private book loaning services owning less than 10,000 books,
optimized for use via a Command Line Interface (CLI),
while still having the benefits of a Graphical User Interface (GUI).

Given below are my contributions to the project.

* **Code contributed**: [RepoSense link](https://nus-cs2103-ay2021s2.github.io/tp-dashboard/?search=arsatis&sort=groupTitle&sortWithin=title&since=2021-02-19&timeframe=commit&mergegroup=&groupSelect=groupByRepos&breakdown=false)

* **New Feature**: Added a `findreader` command that allows the user to find all the readers in SmartLib with a
    specified name.
  * What it does: Allows the user to find readers via their names.
  * Justification: This feature is very important for the product, as users are very likely to have the need to search
    for readers with a particular name, as manually scrolling through the reader list would be very time consuming.
  * Credits: _AB3's prior implementation of `find` guided the implementation of the `findreader` command._

* **New Feature**: Added the ability to find readers via their tags.
  * What it does: Allows the user to find readers via their tags as well, instead of only via their readers' names.
  * Justification: This feature improves the product significantly because a user can quickly obtain a list of all VIPs
    for their library/bookstore, or find the top borrower for the month.
  * Highlights: This enhancement is very useful when used in conjunction with other commands.
    For example, the `deletereader` command can be used to delete a certain VIP from the list,
    if a reader with the `VIP` tag has not visited the user's bookstore for a long period of time.

* **New Feature**: Added a `listreader` command that allows the user to list all the readers in SmartLib.
  * What it does: Allows the user to list all the readers in SmartLib.
  * Justification: This feature is important for enabling the user to retrieve the original reader list,
    after performing the `findreader` command.
  * Highlights: This enhancement is useful when used after `findreader`, so that the user can retrieve the original
    list of all readers in SmartLib.
  * Credits: _AB3's prior implementation of `list` guided the implementation of the `listreader` command._

* **Enhancements to existing features**:
